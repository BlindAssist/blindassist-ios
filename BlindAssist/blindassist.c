/*
 * This code is responsible for analyzing predicted frames and generate a suitable
 * explaination of them for the blind user.
 * 
 * This code will retrieve segmented images using analyse_frame,
 * everytime this method is called, a calculation will be done for the best walkable
 * position for the blind user. 
 * 
 * There are also checks performed to detect obstacles such as poles. Within the scene.
 * 
 * Before a predicition is made, several frames are analysed to guarantee a better
 * understanding of scene.
 * 
 * This code is using percents. Each part of a frame needs to contain a certain 
 * amount of class pixels to make sure it represents the actual object in real life.
 * 
 * After calculation is done, a client can retrieve the results using poll_results.
